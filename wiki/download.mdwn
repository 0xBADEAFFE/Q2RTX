Snapshots
----------------

Nightly built binary packages for Windows and Debian GNU/Linux
and the corresponding source code snapshots can be found
[here](../nightly/).

Source code
----------------

***Code in SVN repository is currently outdated. Q2PRO source tree was
subject to a heavy reorganization. Look in snaphots directory above for
the latest source code until repository is updated.***

To get the source code, you will need to install Subversion client.
Use the following command to checkout the lastest working copy
into the "q2pro" subdirectory:

    svn co https://svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/q2pro/q2pro q2pro

Remember, Q2PRO is in beta stage of development and source code in
the repository may be broken at any given point in time.
If you are not a developer, only proceed with downloading if you
wish to participate in Q2PRO testing and don't mind building the
whole thing yourself.
    
You may also browse Q2PRO source code
[online](http://q2pro.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/q2pro/q2pro).
