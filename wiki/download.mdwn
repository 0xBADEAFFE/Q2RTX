----------------
OpenGL-only client for Win32:
[q2pro-r179ac-win32.zip](http://skuller.ath.cx/q2pro/releases/q2pro-r179ac-win32.zip).
This binary is supported by r1ch.net [anticheat](http://antiche.at/) module.
_Keep in mind this version is quite outdated and is known to contain bugs.
If something does not work as expected, please try a nightly build below._

Debian GNU/Linux
----------------
Those running stable Debian destribution (currently Etch) on i386
architecture can conveniently install pre-built Q2PRO packages from
skuller.ath.cx Debian [repository](http://skuller.ath.cx/debian/).
Just add the following line(s) into your `/etc/apt/sources.list`
and run `aptitude update`:

    deb http://skuller.ath.cx/debian/ etch q2pro
    deb-src http://skuller.ath.cx/debian/ etch q2pro

Users of Secure APT may need to import the repository signing key first:

    wget -O - http://skuller.ath.cx/debian/archive.key | apt-key add -

Nightly builds
----------------
Binary builds and source snapshots from SVN trunk are
[available](http://skuller.ath.cx/q2pro/nightly/). They are regenerated
automatically on nightly basis. You can also find SVN
[changelog](http://q2pro.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/q2pro?view=log) useful.

Source code
----------------
To get the latest Q2PRO source code, you will need to install Subversion
client. Use the following command to checkout fresh working copy into
the `q2pro` directory:

    svn co https://q2pro.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/q2pro/trunk q2pro

If you are looking for the source code snapshot corresponding to
a stable binary release, try the following command, replacing XXX
with release number:

    svn co https://q2pro.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/q2pro/tags/rXXX q2pro-rXXX
