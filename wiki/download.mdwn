Debian GNU/Linux
----------------
Those running stable Debian destribution (currently Etch) on i386
architecture can conveniently install pre-built Q2PRO packages from
skuller.ath.cx Debian [repository](http://skuller.ath.cx/debian/).
Just add the following line(s) into your `/etc/apt/sources.list`
and run `aptitude update`:

    deb http://skuller.ath.cx/debian/ etch q2pro
    deb-src http://skuller.ath.cx/debian/ etch q2pro

Users of Secure APT may need to import the repository signing key first:

    wget -q -O - http://skuller.ath.cx/debian/archive.key | apt-key add -

Nighly builds
----------------
Generic GNU/Linux and Win32 binary builds from SVN trunk are
[available][nightly], along with source snapshots. You might also
find SVN [changelog][svnlog] useful.

[nightly]: http://skuller.ath.cx/q2pro/nightly/
[svnlog]: http://q2pro.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/q2pro?view=log

Source code
----------------
To get the latest Q2PRO source code, you will need to install Subversion
client. Use the following command to checkout fresh working copy into
the `q2pro` directory:

    svn co https://q2pro.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/q2pro/trunk q2pro

If you are looking for the source code snapshot corresponding to
a stable binary release, try the following command, replacing XXX
with release number:

    svn co https://q2pro.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/q2pro/tags/rXXX q2pro-rXXX

You can also [browse](http://q2pro.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/q2pro/)
Q2PRO source tree online.
