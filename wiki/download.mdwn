Debian GNU/Linux
----------------
Prebuilt Q2PRO packages are available for the stable Debian distribution
for i386 and amd64 architectures.

In order to get Q2PRO repository contents automatically managed by APT,
add the following lines into your `/etc/apt/sources.list` file:

    deb http://skuller.ath.cx/debian/ lenny q2pro
    deb-src http://skuller.ath.cx/debian/ lenny q2pro

Users of Secure APT also need to import the repository signing key:

    wget -q -O - http://skuller.ath.cx/debian/archive.key | apt-key add -

Finally, run the following commands to install or upgrade Q2PRO:

    aptitude update
    aptitude install q2pro-client   # install the graphical client
    aptitude install q2pro-server   # install the dedicated server

It is also possible to download the individual [.deb][debs] packages
and install them manually using `dpkg -i` command.

Note that Q2PRO packages above are not providing any game media files
for Quake 2 like textures and maps. You need to install them yourself,
otherwise graphical client won't run.

Nightly builds
----------------
Generic GNU/Linux and Win32 binary builds from SVN trunk are
[available][nightly], along with source snapshots. You might also
find SVN [changelog][svnlog] useful.

Source code
----------------
To get the latest Q2PRO source code, you will need to install Subversion
client. Use the following command to checkout fresh working copy into
the `q2pro` directory:

    svn co https://q2pro.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/q2pro/trunk q2pro

If you are looking for the source code snapshot corresponding to
a stable binary release, try the following command, replacing XXX
with release number:

    svn co https://q2pro.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/q2pro/tags/rXXX q2pro-rXXX

You can also [browse](http://q2pro.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/q2pro/)
