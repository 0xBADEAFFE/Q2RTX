Q2PRO is a [Quake2][] game engine modification, based on source code
released under the GPL by id Software. This is not a standalone game as it
does not provide own media content.

Client and server sides are both compatible with original Quake2 network
architecture, as well as with modern [R1Q2][] network architecture.
Q2PRO is designed to be secure, fast alternative engine will little to no
visual enhancements, but not too conservative.
It provides some features yet unique for the Quake2 gaming world,
notably server side [MVD][] support and built-in capabilities of
hosting [GTV][] server nodes.

Q2PRO has it's own software and OpenGL refresh libraries and runs on
Windows and GNU/Linux natively. It may compile and run on other
Unix-like systems too.
