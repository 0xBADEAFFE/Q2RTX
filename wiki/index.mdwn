Introduction
-----------------

Q2PRO is a [Quake 2][q2] engine modification, based on source code released
under the GPL by id Software. This is not a standalone game as it does not
provide own media content, but rather an enhancement over original Quake 2
release designed for multiplayer use.


Feature highlights
-----------------

* __Performance increases.__ OpenGL renderer has been completely
  rewritten to take full advantage of capabilities of modern hardware.
  By greatly reducing driver overhead, Q2PRO provides performace
  increases up to 200% of default Quake 2 renderer speed.

* __Enhanced console input.__ Autocompletes not just command and cvar names,
  but also arguments of many frequently used commands. Graphical client console
  supports most of readline(3) key bindings, what makes command line editing
  much more convenient.

* __Basic demo editing.__ Allows one to record a demo while playing
  back another one. There is no longer need for external demo editor to perform
  basic operations like cutting interesting frags out of a demo.

* __Integrated demo and server browsers.__ Allows one to easily manage
  their demo collection by providing integrated demo browser. Address book
  functionality is greatly improved by providing integrated server browser.

* __Multi View Demo support.__ Server is capable of recording and playing
  back demos in special MVD format, capturing views from each player in game.
  During playback, spectators themselves choose which view they would like to watch.
  This is completely transparent and supported for _all_ Quake 2 clients.

* __Game TeleVision support.__ Server may act as game retranslator node,
  allowing large amount of spectators watch game in real time without putting any
  additional load on the game server itself. Furthermore, broadcasting is
  done with all benefits of MVD format. There is no need for "camera man",
  unlike other GTV implementations.

* __Frame rates separation.__ Client provides "true" networking, physics,
  rendering and input polling frame rates separation. Unlike other Quake 2 clients,
  Q2PRO will not waste CPU cycles drawing frames never actually seen on screen,
  but will poll for user input instead in order to minimize input latency.

* __Anti-cheat measures.__ Client builds for Windows may optionally load
  [r1ch.net anticheat][ac] module to authenticate themselves to anticheat-enabled
  servers. On the other side, Q2PRO server itself is capable of serving
  anticheat-enabled clients.

* __Improved security and stability.__ Developed with security in mind, Q2PRO
  carefully handles all untrusted data, including data coming from the network
  as well as local files like game media.

* __Support for several platforms.__ Client and server run natively on
  Windows as well as many Unix-like systems, where Q2PRO client uses highly
  portable SDL library for graphical and sound output.
