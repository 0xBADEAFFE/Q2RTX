Introduction
-----------------

Q2PRO is a [Quake2][] engine modification, based on source code released
under the GPL by id Software. This is not a standalone game as it does not
provide own media content, but rather an enhancement over original Quake2
release designed for everyday use.


Feature highlights
-----------------

* __Improved security and stability.__ Q2PRO client and server, being in
  development since 2003, addresses all critical Quake2 engine vulnerabilities
  known to the author.

* __Performance increases.__ OpenGL refresh module has been completely
  rewritten to take full advantage of capabilities of modern hardware.
  By greatly reducing driver overhead, Q2PRO provides performace
  increases up to 200% of default Quake2 renderer speed.

* __Enhanced console input.__ Q2PRO supports bash(1)-like autocompletion not of
  just commands and cvars, but also agruments of many frequently used commands.
  Graphical client console supports most of readline(3) key bindings, which makes
  command line editing much more convenient.

* __Basic demo editing.__ Good news for those frustrated of inability of
  Quake2 client to record demos while playing back: Q2PRO supports this
  natively. There is no longer need for external demo editor to perform some
  basic operations like cutting interesting frags out of a demo.

* __Support for several platforms.__ Q2PRO client and server natively run on
  Windows as well as many UNIX-like systems. Q2PRO client uses cross-platform
  SDL library for graphical output on UNIX.

* __Integrated demo and server browser.__ Q2PRO client allows one easily manage
  their demo collection by providing integrated demo browser. Address book
  functionality is greatly improved by providing integrated server browser.

* __Multi View Demo support.__ Q2PRO server is capable of recording and playing
  back demos is special MVD format, which captures view updates of all players.
  Clients themselves choose which view they would like to watch during playback,
  which is completely transparent and supported for _all_ Quake2 clients.

* __Game TeleVision support.__ Q2PRO server may act as game retranslator node,
  allowing massive amount of spectators watch game match in real time without
  putting any additional load on the game server itself. Furthermore, broadcasting is
  done in MVD format natively, which allows any particular spectator individually
  choose which view they would like to watch. There is no need for "camera man",
  unlike many other GTV implementations.

* __Frame rates separation.__ Q2PRO client provides "true" networking, physics,
  rendering and input polling frame rates separation. Unlike other Quake2 clients,
  Q2PRO will not waste CPU cycles drawing frames never actually seen on screen,
  but will poll for user input instead in order to minimize input latency.

* __Anti-cheat measures.__ Q2PRO client builds for Windows may optionally load
  [r1ch.net anticheat][ac] module to authenticate themselves to anticheat-enabled
  servers. On other side, Q2PRO server itself is capable of serving
  anticheat-enabled clients.
