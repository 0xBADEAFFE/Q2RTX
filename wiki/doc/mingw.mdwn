First, download [MinGW/MSYS][mingw] packages.
Required packages are: `mingw-runtime`, `w32api`,
`binutils`, `gcc` and MSYS graphical installer.
Alternatively, [Cygwin][] packages may be used,
although the process is not described here.

It is recommended to install MSYS using graphical installer first,
then uncompress each MinGW package into the `mingw/`
subdirectory of your MSYS main directory.

You also need to build [zlib][] and install appropriate headers and
libraries into your MinGW tree. By adding `--disable-zlib` option to
configure script you may disable linking with zlib, but this is not recommended.

If you wish to include support for DirectSound and DirectInput drivers into
the client executable, you also need to get `dsound.h` and `dinput.h` files
from MS DirectX SDK and place them into your include path. No extra libraries
are required. Then add the following options to configure
script: `--enable-dsound --enable-dinput`.

If you wish to include support for 32bit textures into OpenGL refresh library,
you need to build [jpeglib][] and [pnglib][] and install appropriate headers
and libraries into your MinGW tree. Then add the following options to
configure script: `--enable-jpeg --enable-png`.

[cygwin]: http://www.cygwin.com/
[zlib]: http://www.zlib.net/
[jpeglib]: http://www.ijg.org/
[pnglib]: http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/

Enter the following commands at MSYS prompt:

    cd q2pro
    ./configure [options]
    make

This should build the following files in the root direcory:

* q2pro.exe - client executable
* q2proded.exe - dedicated server
* ref_gl.dll - OpenGL refresh library
* ref_soft.dll - software refresh library

Do not run `make install` as it will not do what you want.
On Windows, Q2PRO is not designed to run shared between users and you have to
install it manually into your Quake2 directory.

Install Q2PRO as follows, assuming `c:\quake2` is your Quake2 directory:

    c:\quake2\q2pro.exe
    c:\quake2\q2proded.exe
    c:\quake2\baseq2pro\ref_gl.dll
    c:\quake2\baseq2pro\ref_soft.dll
