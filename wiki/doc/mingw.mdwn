As a first step, download [MinGW/MSYS][mingw] packages. Required packages are:
`mingw-runtime`, `w32api`, `binutils`, `gcc` and MSYS graphical installer.
Alternatively, [Cygwin][] installation can be used, although the process
is not described here.

It is recommended to install MSYS using graphical installer first,
then uncompress each MinGW package into the `mingw/` subdirectory
of your MSYS main directory.

You also need to build [zlib][] and install appropriate headers and
libraries into your MinGW tree. By adding `--disable-zlib` option to
configure script you can disable linking with zlib, but this is not
a good idea as this will likely break network compatibility.

If you wish to include support for DirectSound and DirectInput drivers into
the client executable, you also need to get `dsound.h` and `dinput.h` files
from MS DirectX SDK and place them into your include path. No extra libraries
are required. Then add the following options to configure
script: `--enable-dsound --enable-dinput`.

If you wish to include support for 32 bit textures, you need to build
[libjpeg][] and [libpng][] and install appropriate headers and libraries
into your MinGW tree. Then add the following options to configure script:
`--enable-jpeg --enable-png`.

[mingw]: http://mingw.org/download.shtml
[cygwin]: http://www.cygwin.com/
[zlib]: http://www.zlib.net/
[libjpeg]: http://www.ijg.org/
[libpng]: http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/

Enter the following commands at MSYS prompt:

    cd /path/to/q2pro/source/tree
    ./configure [options]
    make

This should build the following files in the current direcory:

* q2pro.exe - graphical client (with built-in OpenGL renderer)
* q2proded.exe - dedicated server

On Windows, `install` target is not supported as Q2PRO is not designed to
run shared between users there. You need to manually move executables into
your Quake 2 directory.
