Variables
==========

Misc
----------

- `set sv_iplimit 3` (integer)  
Maximum number of simultaneous connections allowed from
single IP address. Setting this variable to 0 disables the limit.

- `set sv_status_show 2` (integer)  
Specifies how the server should respond to status queries
over UDP datagrams and HTTP.
   - 0 - do not respond at all
   - 1 - respond with server info only
   - 2 - respond with server info and player list

- `set sv_status_limit 15` (integer)  
Maximum number of status queries per one second server should respond to.

- `set sv_badauth_time 1` (integer)  
Time, in seconds, for server to be unresponsive after an invalid
authentication attempt. This applies to rcon commands, as well as
authenticated connection requests.
    
- `set sv_password ""` (string)  
If not empty, allows only authenticated clients to connect.
Authenticated clients are allowed to occupy reserved slots, see below.
Clients set their passwords via `password` userinfo variable.

- `set sv_reserved_slots 0` (integer)  
Number of client slots to be occupied only by clients who
know `sv_reserved_password` or `sv_password`. Must be less than
`maxclients` value. If `sv_mvd_enable` is non-zero and `sv_reserved_slots`
is zero, `sv_reserved_slots` is automatically set to one to reserve a slot
for dummy MVD observer. NOTE: `sv_reserved_slots` value is subtracted from
`maxclients` value when displayed in server info!

- `set sv_reserved_password ""` (string)  
See above. If empty, no one is allowed to occupy reserved slot(s), except of
dummy MVD observer. Clients set their passwords via `password` userinfo variable.

- `set sv_lan_force_rate 0` (boolean)  
When enabled, do not enforce any rate limits for clients whose IP is from
private address space (127.x.x.x, 10.x.x.x, 192.168.x.x, 172.16.x.x).

- `set sv_ghostime 6` (float)  
Maximum time, in seconds, to keep clients which passed initial
challenge-response connection stage but not yet requested server data chunk.
This also applies to HTTP clients in request processing stage.
Helps to avoid attacks flooding server with zombie clients, combined
with `sv_iplimit` variable.

- `set sv_force_reconnect ""` (string)  
When set to address string, forces new clients to reconnect to this address
as an additional proxy protection measure. This reconnection process is FAST.

- `set sv_uptime 0` (boolean)  
Display uptime in server info.


MVD server
----------

- `set sv_http_enable 0` (boolean)  
Enable HTTP connections, which are used for serving MVD clients and
status queries in HTML.

- `set sv_http_maxclients 4` (integer)  
Maximum number of HTTP clients. Can be changed at any time, setting this to
zero effectively disables new HTTP connections.

- `set sv_http_minclients 4` (integer)  
Maximum number of HTTP clients to be kept in the special pool of recently
used slots for faster access and avoiding memory fragmentation.

- `set sv_mvd_nogun 1` (boolean)  

- `set sv_mvd_noblend 0` (boolean)  

- `set sv_mvd_max_duration 0` (boolean)  

- `set sv_mvd_max_size 0` (boolean)  

- `set sv_mvd_wait 0` (boolean)  

- `set sv_mvd_auth ""` (string)  
If not empty, perform Basic HTTP authentication of MVD connections.
Value should be in form of `user:pass`.

- `set sv_mvd_enable 0` (boolean)  
Enable recording local MVDs and serving MVD clients over HTTP.

- `set sv_mvd_begincmd "wait 50; putaway; wait 10; help;"` (string)  
Issue this command on behaf of dummy MVD observer as soon as it
enters the game. Do any game mod dependant preparations here to make sure
MVD observer enters an appropriate spectator team, opens the scoreboard, etc.
Each `wait` cycle lasts 0.1 second here.

- `set sv_mvd_scorecmd "putaway; wait 10; help;"` (string)  
Issue this command on behaf of dummy MVD observer each time no layout
updates are detected for more than 9 seconds. Useful for reopening the
scoreboard if the game mod closes it for some reason.
Each `wait` cycle lasts 0.1 second here.


MVD client
----------

- `set mvd_shownet 0` (integer)  
Dump contents of the MVD stream as it is parsed.
Higher values mean higher verbosity.

- `set mvd_debug 0` (integer)  
Display some MVD client related development information.
Higher values mean higher verbosity.

- `set mvd_pause 0` (boolean)  
Pause MVD playback if non-zero.

- `set mvd_timeout 120` (float)    
Specifies MVD connection timeout value, in seconds.

- `set mvd_wait_enter 0.5` (float)  
Inuse percentage of the input buffer when MVD state
machine transitions from running state into waiting state.

- `set mvd_wait_leave 2` (float)  
Inuse percentage of the input buffer when MVD state
machine transitions from waiting state into running state.

Hacks
----------

- `set sv_oldgame_hack 0` (boolean)  
On Unix systems, enables "binary compatibility mode" so game libraries
built using old GCC versions may be loaded without recompilation.
If you have to use some closed source mod and your server segfaults
while loading a map, try toggling this variable.

- `set sv_bodyque_hack 0` (boolean)  
Attempts to prevent "flying bodies" effect introduced by some buggy
mods. This hack assumes the mod allocates certain range of entity
slots for "body queue" and disables client side interpolation of
those entities. Use this hack with caution as it may not be compatible
with all mods and causes slightly higher bandwidth usage.

- `set sv_strafejump_hack 0` (boolean)  
Enables FPS-independent strafe jumping mode for clients supporting R1Q2
and Q2PRO protocols.



Macros
==========

- `$sv_client` Expands to the name of the client currently being processed.


Commands
==========

- `stuff <userid> <text ...>`  
Stuff the given _text_ into command buffer of the client identified by _userid_.

- `stuffall <text ...>`  
Stuff the given _text_ into command buffers of all connected clients.

- `pick <address:port>`  
Send `passive_connect` packet to the client at specified _address_ and _port_.
This is useful if the server is behind NAT or firewall and can not accept remote
connections. Remote client must support passive connections (R1Q2 and Q2PRO
clients do), must be in passive connection mode and the specified _port_
must be reachable. See `passive` [[client#index3h1]] command for more details.

- `mvdplay [-hl:n:] <filename> [...]`  
Play the local MVD identified by _filename_.

- `mvdconnect [-hi:n:] [http://][user:pass@]<host>[:port][/resource]`  
Connect to the MVD resource identified by _URI_. If _resource_ part is given,
default port is 80. Otherwise, default port is 27910 and _streamID_ identifies
the live MVD stream on server.

- `mvdisconnect [chanid]`  
Disconnect the specified channel from the server. There is no need to
specify `chanid` if there is only one active channel.

- `mvdkill [chanid]`  
Kill the specified channel. There is no need to specify `chanid` if
there is only one active channel.

- `mvdspawn`  
Spawn MVD client instance, that is, Waiting Room channel.

- `mvdchannels`  
Display status of all MVD channels.

- `mvdstuff <text>`  
Stuff the specified text into command buffer of the dummy MVD observer.
Should be issued on _game_ server, not on MVD client.

Anticheat
==========

Q2PRO server supports r1ch.net anticheat server interface, which means it is
capable of serving clients supported by the proprietary client side anticheat
module (currently, these include Windows builds of R1Q2, EGL and AprQ2).

See this [thread](http://www.r1ch.net/forum/index.php?topic=944.0) on r1ch.net
forums for more information on how to setup your server to use anticheat
interface.

Q2PRO anticheat server interface is implemented on top of R1Q2 reference
implementation. All R1Q2 variables and commands related to anticheat are
supported, except of `sv_anticheat_nag_*`, `sv_anticheat_client_restrictions`
and `sv_anticheat_force_protocol35` variables.
