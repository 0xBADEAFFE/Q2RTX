Variables
==========

Misc
----------

- `set sv_iplimit 3`  
Maximum number of simultaneous connections allowed from
single IP address. Setting this variable to 0 disables the limit.

- `set sv_status_show 2`  
Specifies how the server should respond to status queries.
   - 0 - do not respond at all
   - 1 - respond with server info only
   - 2 - respond with server info and player list

- `set sv_status_limit 15`  
Maximum number of status queries per one second server should respond to.

- `set sv_badauth_time 1`  
Time, in seconds, for server to be unresponsive after an invalid
authentication attempt. This applies to rcon commands, as well as
authenticated connection requests.
    
- `set sv_password ""`  
If not empty, allows only authenticated clients to connect.
Clients set their passwords via "password" userinfo variable.

- `set sv_reserved_slots 0`  

- `set sv_reserved_password ""`  

- `set sv_lan_force_rate 0`  

- `set sv_ghostime 6`  



MVD server
----------

- `set sv_http_enable 0`  
Enable HTTP connections. Currently used for MVD connections and
status queries only.

- `set sv_http_maxclients 32`  
Maximum number of HTTP clients.

- `set sv_http_minclients "8"`  

- `set sv_mvd_nogun "1"`  

- `set sv_mvd_noblend "0"`  

- `set sv_mvd_max_duration "0"`  

- `set sv_mvd_max_size "0"`  

- `set sv_mvd_wait "0"`  

- `set sv_mvd_auth ""`  

- `set sv_mvd_enable "0"`  


MVD client
----------

- `set mvd_shownet 0` (integer)  
Dump contents of the MVD stream as it is parsed.
Higher values mean higher verbosity.

- `set mvd_debug 0` (integer)  
Display some MVD client related development information.
Higher values mean higher verbosity.

- `set mvd_pause 0` (boolean)  
Pause MVD playback if non-zero.

- `set mvd_timeout 120` (float)    
Specifies MVD connection timeout value, in seconds.

- `set mvd_wait_enter 0.5` (float)  
Inuse percentage of the input buffer when MVD state
machine transitions from running state into waiting state.

- `set mvd_wait_leave 2` (float)  
Inuse percentage of the input buffer when MVD state
machine transitions from waiting state into running state.

Hacks
----------

- `set sv_oldgame_hack 0` (boolean)  
On Unix systems, enables "binary compatibility mode" so game libraries
built using old GCC versions may be loaded without recompilation.
If you have to use some closed source mod and your server segfaults
while loading a map, try toggling this variable.

- `set sv_bodyque_hack 0` (boolean)  
Attempts to prevent "flying bodies" effect introduced by some buggy
mods. This hack assumes the mod allocates certain range of entity
slots for "body queue" and disables client side interpolation of
those entities. Use this hack with caution as it may not be compatible
with all mods and causes slightly higher bandwidth usage.

- `set sv_strafejump_hack 0` (boolean)  
Enables FPS-independent strafe jumping mode for clients supporting R1Q2
and Q2PRO protocols.



Macros
==========

- `$sv_client` Expands to the name of the client currently being processed.


Commands
==========

- `stuff <userid> <text ...>`  
Stuff the given _text_ into command buffer of the client identified by _userid_.

- `stuffall <text ...>`  
Stuff the given _text_ into command buffers of all connected clients.

- `pick <address:port>`  
Send `passive_connect` packet to the client at specified _address_ and _port_.
This is useful if the server is behind NAT or firewall and can not accept remote
connections. Remote client must support passive connections (R1Q2 and Q2PRO
clients do), must be in passive connection mode and the specified _port_
must be reachable. See `passive` [[client#index3h1]] command for more details.

- `mvdplay <filename>`  
Play the local MVD identified by _filename_.

- `mvdconnect <[http://][user:pass@]server[:port][/resource]> [streamID]`  
Connect to the MVD resource identified by _URI_. If _resource_ part is given,
default port is 80. Otherwise, default port is 27910 and _streamID_ identifies
the live MVD stream on server.

- `mvdisconnect`  

- `mvdspawn`  
Spawn MVD client instance.

- `mvdchannels`  
Display status of all MVD channels.
