Prerequisities
------------------
Q2PRO client currently uses OSS for sound output and libSDL for video output.
Both client and dedicated server require zlib support for full network
protocol compatibility. OpenGL refresh library recommends libjpeg and
libpng+zlib for 32-bit textures support.

Installation
------------------
`cd' to the directory containing Q2PRO source code and type `./configure'.

The configuration shell script supplied with Q2PRO does not automatically
detect installed libraries, required features should be specified manually.
Type `./configure --help' to display possible configuration options.

Type `make' to compile Q2PRO and `make install' to install.

Type `make clean' to remove object files from source tree and `make distclean'
to remove files generated by `configure'.
