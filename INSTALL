Prerequisities
------------------
Q2PRO client currently uses OSS for sound output and libSDL for video output.
Both client and dedicated server require zlib support for full network
protocol compatibility. OpenGL refresh library recommends libjpeg and
libpng+zlib for 32 bit textures support.


Installation
------------------
`cd' to the directory containing Q2PRO source code and type `./configure'.

The configuration shell script supplied with Q2PRO does not automatically
detect installed libraries, required features should be specified manually.
Type `./configure --help' to display possible configuration options.

Type `make' to compile Q2PRO and `make install' to install.

Type `make clean' to remove object files from source tree and `make distclean'
to remove files generated by `configure'.


Generic configuration
------------------

--cross-prefix=PREFIX
  Prepend PREFIX to compile tools names. Use for cross-compiling,
  for example: `./configure --cross-prefix=i586-mingw32-msvc'.

--disable-client
  Do not build graphical client.

--enable-server
  Build dedicated server.

--enable-baseq2
  Build base Quake 2 game module.

--disable-asm
  Do not use optimized i386 assembly code.

--enable-anticheat
  Enable r1ch.net anticheat server interface.


MinGW specific
------------------

--enable-mingw
  Force MinGW build environment (use for cross-compiling) instead of
  autodetecting host environment.

--enable-dsound
  Enable DirectSound driver (need dsound.h from DirectX SDK).

--enable-dinput
  Enable DirectInput driver (need dinput.h from DirectX SDK).

--disable-wave
  Disable WAVE sound driver.


Linux specific
------------------
--disable-oss
  Disable OSS sound driver.

--disable-evdev
  Disable Evdev input driver.


External libraries
------------------

--disable-zlib
  Do not link against zlib. Not recommended for client builds, as
  this will break network protocol compatibility with some servers,

--enable-png
  Link against PNG library.

--enable-jpeg
  Link against JPEG library.


Paths configuration
------------------

--single-user
  Build single user executables meant to be manually installed into user
  home directory, just like the original Quake 2 release did.

--prefix=PREFIX [/usr/local]
  Prepend PREFIX to the all paths specified below (except of --homedir).

--datadir=DIR [share/games/quake2]
  Path to the static game data tree. This data tree can be shared between
  different Quake 2 engines installed on a host.

--libdir=DIR [lib/games/quake2]
  Path to the game modules tree. This modules tree can be shared between
  different Quake 2 engines installed on a host.

--refdir=DIR [lib/games/q2pro]
  Path to the Q2PRO-specific modules tree (refresh modules, etc).

--bindir=DIR [games]
  Install main Q2PRO executables here.

--mandir=DIR [share/man/man6]
  Install Q2PRO manual pages here.

--homedir=DIR [~/.q2pro]
  Name of the directory where Q2PRO stores per-user data. Tilde at the
  beginning of the name is automatically expanded to user home directory
  at run time.
