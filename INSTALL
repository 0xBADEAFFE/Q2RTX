Prerequisities
------------------
On Linux, Q2PRO client currently depends on libSDL for video output.
Both client and dedicated server require zlib support for full network
protocol compatibility. Evdev mouse input is recommended, since the way SDL
works around non-existent X11 relative mouse input support is horrible.


Installation
------------------
`cd' to the directory containing Q2PRO source code and type `./configure'.

The configuration shell script supplied with Q2PRO does not automatically
detect installed libraries, required features should be specified manually.
Type `./configure --help' to display possible configuration options.

Type `make' to compile Q2PRO and `make install' to install.

Type `make clean' to remove object files from source tree and `make distclean'
to remove files generated by `configure'.


Generic configuration
------------------

--cross-prefix=PREFIX
  Prepend PREFIX to compile tools names. Use for cross-compiling,
  for example: `./configure --cross-prefix=i586-mingw32-msvc'.

--enable-mingw
  Force MinGW build environment (use for cross-compiling) instead of
  autodetecting host environment.

--disable-client
  Do not build graphical client.

--enable-server
  Build dedicated server.

--enable-baseq2
  Build base Quake 2 game module.

--disable-asm
  Do not use optimized i386 assembly code.


Server configuration
------------------

--enable-anticheat
  Enable r1ch.net anticheat server interface.

--disable-mvd-server
  Disable local MVD recording and accepting remote GTV connections from relay nodes.

--disable-mvd-client
  Disable GTV relay node functionality.


Client configuration
------------------

--enable-dsound
  Enable `direct' sound driver (DirectSound on Win32, OSS on Linux).

--enable-dinput
  Enable `direct' input driver (DirectInput on Win32, Evdev on Linux).

--enable-openal
  Enable OpenAL sound engine (OpenAL driver will be dynamically loaded
  at run time, just like OpenGL driver).

--disable-snddma
  Disable DMA sound engine. Can't be used without `--enable-openal'.


External libraries (mostly client)
------------------

--disable-zlib
  Do not link against zlib. Not recommended for client builds, as
  this will break network protocol compatibility with some servers.

--enable-png
  Enable PNG textures by linking against libpng.

--enable-jpg
  Enable JPEG textures by linking against libjpeg.

--enable-curl
  Enable HTTP downloads by linking against libcurl.

--enable-lirc
  Enable LIRC input by linking against liblirc_client.


Paths configuration
------------------

--single-user
  Build single user executables meant to be manually installed into the user
  home directory, just like the original Quake 2 release did. Useful for running
  Quake 2 server under the limited user account, and not recommended for anything
  else.

--prefix=PREFIX [/usr/local]
  Prepend PREFIX to the all paths specified below (except of --homedir).

--datadir=DIR [share/games/quake2]
  Path to the static game data tree. This data tree can be shared between
  different Quake 2 engines installed on a host.

--libdir=DIR [lib/games/quake2]
  Path to the game modules tree. This modules tree can be shared between
  different Quake 2 engines installed on a host.

--refdir=DIR [lib/games/q2pro]
  Path to the Q2PRO-specific modules tree (refresh modules, etc).

--bindir=DIR [games]
  Install main Q2PRO executables here.

--mandir=DIR [share/man/man6]
  Install Q2PRO manual pages here.

--homedir=DIR [~/.q2pro]
  Name of the directory where Q2PRO stores per-user data. Tilde at the
  beginning of the name is automatically expanded to user home directory
  at run time.
