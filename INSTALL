Prerequisities
--------------

On all platforms except Windows, Q2PRO client depends on libSDL for video
output. Both client and dedicated server require zlib support for full network
protocol compatibility.

To install the full set of dependencies for building Q2PRO on Debian-based
Linux distributions, use the following command:

    apt-get install libc6-dev libx11-dev libsdl1.2-dev libopenal-dev \
                    libpng12-dev libjpeg62-dev zlib1g-dev mesa-common-dev \
                    liblircclient-dev libcurl-dev

Users of other distributions should look for equivalent development packages
and install them.


Building
--------

Q2PRO uses a simple build system consisting of a single top-level Makefile and
an optional build-time configuration file. Copy an example configuration file
from `doc/examples/buildconfig' to `.config' and modify it to suit your needs.

Type `make' to build a client, dedicated server and baseq2 game library. Type
`make strip' to strip off debugging symbols from resulting executables. Type
`make clean' to remove all generated executables, object files and
dependencies.

To enable verbose output during the build, set the V variable, e.g. `make V=1'.
