Changes since r529
==================

Features:
---------

* Master servers are now automatically re-resolved after one day to
  accomodate changing IP addresses. Added ‘listmasters’ command.

* Finer grain control of rate limiting: ‘<limit>[/<period>[sec|min|hour]]’
  syntax is now allowed for ‘sv_status_limit’ and newly added ‘sv_auth_limit’
  and ‘sv_rcon_limit’ cvars, replacing ‘sv_badauth_time’.

* Added ‘(add|del|list)blackhole(s)’ commands for ignoring connectionless
  packets from IP blocks and preventing logfile flood.

* Added ‘sv_enhanced_setplayer’ cvar to enable partial client name matching
  for regular server console commands like ‘kick’, etc.

Bugfixes:
---------

* Fixed file handle leak in ‘download’ client command handler
  preventing server from opening new files with spurious ‘No such
  file or directory’ message.

* Fixed rcon rate limiting not working properly when server is down.

* Fixed a server crash when ‘map_override_path’ feature is in use.

* Prevent spurious ‘No visibility data’ notification in the waiting
  room MVD/GTV channel.

* Fixed a bug causing rcon responses from server to be listed in client
  console multiple times.

* Client now waits for HTTP downloads to finish before attempting to load
  the map, so that textures, etc are properly downloaded.


Changes since r496
==================

Features:
---------

* Added support for quake2://<address>[/] scheme.

* Added ‘gl_bilerp_pics’ cvar for controlling bilinear filtering of HUD
  pictures.

* Small HUD pictures stored in the scrap are no longer filtered by default,
  they should look better when ‘scr_scale’ is used.

* Added ‘m_autosens’ cvar.

* Added support for crosshair coloring, added ‘ch_red/ch_green/ch_blue’
  cvars.

* Re-introduced support for message triggers, added ‘trigger’ and ‘untrigger’
  commands.

* When macro expansion is performed, ‘$var$’ syntax in allowed now 
  for compatibility with other clients.

Bugfixes:
---------

* Fixed loading of JPEG files with non-RGB colorspaces.

* Missing or invalid sounds are now silently ignored to avoid console spam.


Changes since r396
==================

Features:
---------

* Added support for HTTP downloads using libCURL.

* Added OpenAL 1.1 sound engine with Linear Distance Model support,
  which should be very close to the original Q2 sound with useful
  features like 5.1 channel output.

* Added support for receiving input from the LIRC daemon on Linux.

* Added ‘scr_lag_max’ cvar for controlling lagometer scale.

* Added ‘r_fps’, ‘cl_mps’ and ‘cl_pps’ macros displaying current
  rendering FPS, moves per second and packets per second rates.

* High gl_modulate values now completely cancel entity glowing effect,
  just like original Q2 renderer does.

* Added support for loading monochrome JPEG images.

* MVD channels menu is now automatically refreshed.

* MVD channels are no longer destroyed when GTV server fails to
  load the map, they are used with null visibility info instead.

* Server ‘status p’ command now lists various protocol details like
  maxmsglen, netchan type, zlib support, etc.

* On Linux, Path MTU Discovery is now disabled on UDP sockets, so that
  kernel allows IP level fragmentation of outgoing packets, allowing clients
  with smaller MTU sizes to connect.

* Improved IO handling: use only single select() call per frame.

* More efficient custom code for reading ZIP packfiles is now used
  instead of PKZIP library.

* Implemented new error reporting framework based on errno and custom error codes.


Bugfixes:
---------

* Improved ‘oldscores’ GTV client command handling with OpenTDM.

* Fixed off-by-one error when printing argument to the ‘!’ chase target escape.

* Fixed floating point division by zero in packet loss ratio calculations.

* Fixed a memory leak in ‘mvdstop’ GTV server command.

* Fixed improper handling of status responses from servers client is connecting to.

* Removed ‘Server rejected loopback connection’ error message.

* Fixed off-by-one errors in lightstyle and muzzle flash parsing code.

* Fixed integer overflow in sound loading code.

* Fixed possible access to uninitialized memory in BSP loading code.

* Fixed old Q2 bug in Netchan_Transmit causing reliable retransmits to be
  delayed one ack longer than needed.

* Empty files and directories inside ZIP packfiles are now skipped.

* Fixed endianess issues in sound and image loading code.

* Maximum loadable file size is now limited to 64 MiB to protect
  against malicious paks causing memory exhaustion.

* Fixed ‘mvdskip’ command not working properly.

* Fixed a crash in ‘mvdplay’ command possible when demo file is invalid.

* Fixed a memory leak in JPEG and PNG image reading and writing functions.
